R Analysis Pipeline:
All scripts should be run using R studio version 1.2.5003 "orange blossom" and R version 3.4.3

1. Use "CaImAn CSV Restructure" to change the CSV format of traces generated by CaImAn.
2. "CaImAn Trace Alignment" requires cell traces and ordered CellReg output for the session that is being aligned. 
This will reorder cell traces so that cells match their alignment ID from CellReg. Original version created by Martin Raymond.
3. "Combined Session Trial Generator" takes aligned traces from step 2 and timepoints to crop session-long traces into individual taste trials.
4. "pathID sheet generator" combines all outputs from step 3 and combines them to form one large CSV for cell traces aligned over days and cropped
to taste trials. 
5. "Responsive Cell Analysis" sets thresholds for significant taste responses, creates dataframes of responsive cells (enhanced and inhibited),
creates dataframes of cells that are tracked across days and cells that are specific to single days. Original version created by Cameron Ogg.
